<H2>If you've arrived here it might for one of a number of reasons:</H2><UL>
<LI>The page did not load correctly: It might be that the error 404 has appeared for the simple reason that the page did not load properly. This can be checked quite easily by clicking on the "Refresh" button in your browser or by pressing the F5 button.
<LI>Check the URL: Regardless of whether you have entered the URL address manually or have been directed via a link, it could be that a mistake has been made. For this reason you should check the URL. It could be that either you, or the person who entered the link, has mistyped something.
<LI>You may wish to use a search to check which page on my website you are looking for (ignore any advert links at the top of the search results):<div><script async src="https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=957cf79d8c94dc15b"></script>
<div class="gcse-search"></div></div>
<LI>Delete the browser cache and cookies: If you can access the website from another device, and the HTTP 404 error only seems to appear on a certain computer, then the problem could lie with your browser. Therefore, you should delete the browser cache as well as all cookies for this site, and this may then finally allow you to access the page.
<LI>It is possible that I have made an error, or that the page has failed to load correctly when I was updating the website: If none of the abovementioned tips have been successful then try emailing me: <A href="mailto:david@biddulph.org.uk">This link to send e-mail to me</A>.
